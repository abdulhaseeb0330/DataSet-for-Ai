# DataSet-for-Ai
A console Based java Application for inserting data in to DataBase for Ai-Based Disease Diagnosis with Advanced Powered Hybrid base Health intelligence
📊 Dataset Builder for AI-Based Disease Diagnosis
💻 Console-Based Java Application + SQL Database
🎯 Project Title: AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis with Hybrid Health Intelligence
🧪 Semester 2 Project

I’ve created a Java console-based application that serves as the foundation for collecting and managing clean, structured medical data — crucial for any AI-driven diagnosis system. The system stores patient details, symptoms, and medication history in SQL Server, enabling future integration with intelligent AI models.

🔍 Core Features:

Add & view patient records

Search by symptom or medicine

Lifelong health record storage

Dataset structure optimized for AI

Built with Java (OOP) and SSMS (SQL)

💡 This project aims to digitize medical data for intelligent systems to learn from, predict diseases, recommend treatments, and assist doctors using hybrid health insights (physical + AI-powered reasoning).

🛠 From handwritten notes to intelligent healthcare — this is just the start.
